/**
 * The central component for deciding whether a request authentication token is valid or not is
 * {@link AuthenticationManager}.
 * <p>
 * AuthenticationManager defines only one method: {@link AuthenticationManager#authenticate(Authentication)}
 * that takes {@link Authentication} as request authentication token and return another authenticated
 * Authentication populated with name, expiration, disability and granted authorities.
 * <p>
 * As you can see, Authentication serves as 2 roles in Spring Security:
 *  1. before authentication, as request token
 *  2. after authentication, as authenticated principal loaded with granted authorities
 *  ({@link Authentication#getAuthorities()}).
 * <p>
 * Authority usually bears the information of user's granted permissions. However this is not mandatory.
 * The implementations of AuthenticationManager could choose not to populate {@link Authentication#getAuthorities()}.
 * The information of granted permission can be extracted from other source such as {@link Authentication#getDetails()}.
 * <p>
 * An authentication flow can be roughly divided into 3 steps as shown in the following pseudo code.
